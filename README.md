.:The project:.
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was a European conflict that acted as a prelude of World War II. In it, the legitimate government of the Spanish II Republic suffered a coup d'etat
from the Military, which resulted in two sides being formed; the Republic (backed eventually by the Soviet Union, Mexico, and the volunteer forces of the International Brigades), and
"the Nationals" (backed by Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy). After 3 years of conflict, the fascist "Nationals" ended up gaining control of the country, kickstarting a
dictatorship which lasted nearly 40 years (1939-1977).

This dictatorship quickly started to repress the population which defended the Republic, and tens of thousands (maybe even hundreds of thousands) were sentenced to death, while others
spent long periods of time incarcerated without trial. Some spent years in "Working Soldiers' Battalions" (unpaid, forced labor units), while others simply were executed in their
villages or cities. A reign of terror was established for nearly 4 decades, where even speaking about these things could be punished with jail time or other forms of repression.

The extraordinary length of the regime has set root in the Spanish society, with all 4 powers (legislature, executive, judiciary and media) being bred with fascist/francoist apology.
This in turn has made it considerably complicated for the generations brought up in democracy to research and learn more about the lives of our grandparents, as all the documentation
generated (trials, incarcerations, belonging to force labor units, and many other forms of repression) are buried deep into military archives, poorly functioning search engines, and
a difficult procedure for accessing or requesting copies of such archives.

This project tries to provide some help to those family members interested in learning more about their relatives who suffered under the war and dictatorship, and to the researchers
who still try to put together an accurate picture of what happened during those dark years of Spanish and European History.

This effort, which I hope will help many people find out more about their past, is dedicated to my grandmother, Isabel, who lost her dad Domingo on July 10th 1941, when she was just
10 years old. He was executed for being part of the Town Hall of his hometown, leaving behind a wife and 3 kids. His proud great-grandson:
